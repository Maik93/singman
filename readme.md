# singman - Singularity Manager
A singularity wrapper that makes its usage easier.

It can:
- build custom recipes;
- create persistant overlays that are applied on top of already built images and re-integrate them;
- convert images to sandboxes and vice-versa;
- run images with fakeroot;
- automatically mount your entire home directory, allowing to work with your files easly;
- run Clion or Pycharm on top of your images.
